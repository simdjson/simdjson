**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

Note that a compiler warning is not a bug.

If we cannot reproduce the issue, then we cannot address it.

Note that a stack trace from your own program is not enough.

 - Version [e.g. 22]

We support up-to-date 64-bit ARM and x64 FreeBSD, macOS, Windows and Linux systems. Please ensure that your configuration is supported before labelling the issue as a bug. In particular, we do not support legacy 32-bit systems.
