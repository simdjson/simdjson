Before submitting an issue, please ensure that you have read the documentation:

* Basics is an overview of how to use simdjson and its APIs: https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson/blob/master/doc/basics.md
* Performance shows some more advanced scenarios and how to tune for them: https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson/blob/master/doc/performance.md

* We follow the [JSON specification as described by RFC 8259](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259.txt) (T. Bray, 2017).

We do not make changes to simdjson without clearly identifiable benefits, which typically means either performance improvements, bug fixes or new features. Avoid bike-shedding: we all have opinions about how to write code, but we want to focus on what makes simdjson objectively better.
