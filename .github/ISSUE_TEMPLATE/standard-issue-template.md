* We follow the [JSON specification as described by RFC 8259](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259.txt) (T. Bray, 2017).

We do not make changes to simdjson without clearly identifiable benefits, which typically means either performance improvements, bug fixes or new features. Avoid bike-shedding: we all have opinions about how to write code, but we want to focus on what makes simdjson objectively better.

Is your issue:

1. A bug report? If so, please point at a reproducible test. Indicate whether you are willing or able to provide a bug fix as a pull request. As a matter of policy, we do not consider a compiler warning to be a bug.

2. A build issue? If so, provide all possible details regarding your system configuration. If we cannot reproduce your issue, we cannot fix it.

3. A feature request? Please provide a clear rationale for the feature. Be advised that simdjson is a community-based project: you should consider providing help.

4. A documentation issue? Can you suggest an improvement?
