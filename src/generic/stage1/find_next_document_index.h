/**
  * This algorithm is used to quickly identify the last structural position that
  * makes up a complete document.
  *
  * It does this by going backwards and finding the last *document boundary* (a
  * place where one value follows another without a comma between them). If the
  * last document (the characters after the boundary) has an equal number of
  * start and end brackets, it is considered complete.
  *
  * Simply put, we iterate over the structural characters, starting from
  * the end. We consider that we found the end of a JSON document when the
  * first element of the pair is NOT one of these characters: '{' '[' ';' ','
  * and when the second element is NOT one of these characters: '}' '}' ';' ','.
  *
  * This simple comparison works most of the time, but it does not cover cases
  * where the batch's structural indexes contain a perfect amount of documents.
  * In such a case, we do not have access to the structural index which follows
  * the last document, therefore, we do not have access to the second element in
  * the pair, and that means we cannot identify the last document. To fix this
  * issue, we keep a count of the open and closed curly/square braces we found
  * while searching for the pair. When we find a pair AND the count of open and
  * closed curly/square braces is the same, we know that we just passed a
  * complete document, therefore the last json buffer location is the end of the
  * batch.
