   * that only one field is returned.
   *
   * **Raw Keys:** The lookup will be done against the *raw* key, and will not unescape keys.
   * e.g. `object["a"]` will match `{ "a": 1 }`, but will *not* match `{ "\u0061": 1 }`.
   *

   * given by content["bids"].get_array() should not be accessed after you have called
   * content["asks"].get_array(). You can detect such mistakes by first compiling and running
   * the code in Debug mode (or with the macro `SIMDJSON_DEVELOPMENT_CHECKS` set to 1): an
   * OUT_OF_ORDER_ITERATION error is generated.

   * You are expected to access keys only once. You should access the value corresponding to a
   * key a single time. Doing object["mykey"].to_string() and then again object["mykey"].to_string()
   * is an error.

  /**
   * Look up a field by name on an object, without regard to key order.
   *
   * **Performance Notes:** This is a bit less performant than find_field(), though its effect varies
   * and often appears negligible. It starts out normally, starting out at the last field; but if
   * the field is not found, it scans from the beginning of the object to see if it missed it. That
   * missing case has a non-cache-friendly bump and lots of extra scanning, especially if the object
   * in question is large. The fact that the extra code is there also bumps the executable size.
   *
   * It is the default, however, because it would be highly surprising (and hard to debug) if the
   * default behavior failed to look up a field just because it was in the wrong order--and many
   * APIs assume this. Therefore, you must be explicit if you want to treat objects as out of order.
   *
   * Use find_field() if you are sure fields will be in order (or are willing to treat it as if the
   * field wasn't there when they aren't).
