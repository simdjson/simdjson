# Final Changes Summary

## Clean Repository State Achieved âœ“

### Ablation Study (`ablation/`)
- **run_ablation_study.sh** - Main ablation script that tests all optimization variants
- **citm_serialization_test.cpp** - CITM test program for ablation
- **ABLATION_RESULTS.md** - Documentation of expected results and methodology

### Unified Benchmark (`benchmark/`)
- **unified_benchmark.cpp** - Complete benchmark comparing simdjson vs other libraries
- **build_unified_benchmark.sh** - Build script with automatic library detection
- **UNIFIED_BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md** - Documentation of benchmark results

### Updated Files
- **.gitignore** - Added rules to exclude CSV results and benchmark binary

### Removed Files
- All temporary scripts (ablation_study_*.sh, run_*.sh)
- All test files (citm_ablation_test.cpp, citm_ablation_simple.cpp)
- Old results directory (ablation_results/)
- citm_issue.md (no longer relevant)

## How to Use

### Run Unified Benchmark
```bash
cd /path/to/simdjson
./benchmark/build_unified_benchmark.sh
./benchmark/unified_benchmark
```

### Run Ablation Study
```bash
cd /path/to/simdjson
./ablation/run_ablation_study.sh
# Or with compilation time analysis:
./ablation/run_ablation_study.sh --enable_compilation
```

## What Each Does

**Unified Benchmark**: Compares simdjson (manual, reflection, from()) against nlohmann/json and RapidJSON using full Twitter and CITM datasets.

**Ablation Study**: Measures the impact of individual optimizations (consteval, SIMD, fast digits, etc.) by disabling them one at a time.

## Results Storage

- Ablation results go to `ablation/results/` (gitignored)
- Benchmark results are displayed on console
- Documentation files contain expected/typical results

This is now ready to push to the repository!
